Description: A collection of tools for visualizing, analyzing, and comparing structured 
    and unstructured urban building patterns in Cairo using spatial vector data. 
    The package provides functions for computing geometric properties such as area, 
    perimeter, and compactness, as well as generating high-quality thematic maps, 
    statistical plots, and spatial aggregations (e.g., hexbin visualizations). 
    Designed for researchers and urban planners working with geospatial data.
