\title{Hexbin Area Analysis of Structured vs. Unstructured Buildings}
\usage{
plot_hexbin_area_analysis(
  unstructured_path,
  structured_path,
  hex_size = 150,
  buffer_dist = 150
)
}
\arguments{
\item{unstructured_path}{Character. File path to the unstructured buildings GeoPackage (.gpkg).}

\item{structured_path}{Character. File path to the structured buildings GeoPackage (.gpkg).}

\item{hex_size}{Numeric. Cell size for hexagonal grid in map units (default 150).}

\item{buffer_dist}{Numeric. Distance for inward buffer to define core study area (default 150).}
}
\value{
A combined patchwork ggplot object showing:
\itemize{
\item Hexbin map of average building area for unstructured buildings (core area)
\item Density plot of average building area for unstructured buildings
\item Hexbin map of average building area for structured buildings (core area)
\item Density plot of average building area for structured buildings
}
}
\description{
This function performs a spatial hexbin aggregation and visualization
comparing building areas between structured and unstructured building datasets.
It reads two GeoPackage files, calculates building areas, creates a shared
hexagonal grid over their combined bounding box, filters to a core study area,
aggregates building counts and average area per hex, filters out outliers,
and produces comparative hexbin maps and density plots.
}
\details{
The function creates a hexagonal grid over the union of the bounding boxes of
the two datasets, filters to core hexes inside an inward buffer of the convex hull,
then spatially joins buildings to hexes. It computes counts and mean area per hex,
filters low-count and outlier hexes, and plots maps and density plots with a shared
color scale.
