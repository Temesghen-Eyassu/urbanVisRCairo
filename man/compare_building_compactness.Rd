\title{Compare Building Compactness: Structured vs. Unstructured Areas}
\usage{
compare_building_compactness(unstructured_path, structured_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{unstructured_path}{Character. File path to unstructured buildings GeoPackage (.gpkg).}

\item{structured_path}{Character. File path to structured buildings GeoPackage (.gpkg).}
}
\value{
A patchwork ggplot object combining boxplot, density plot, and violin plot.
}
\description{
This function reads two building datasets (structured and unstructured),
calculates building compactness, and creates a combined visualization with
boxplots, density plots, and violin plots comparing compactness distributions.
