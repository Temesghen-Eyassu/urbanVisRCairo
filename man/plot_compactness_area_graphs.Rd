\title{Plot Compactness Analysis for Structured and Unstructured Buildings}
\usage{
plot_compactness_area_graphs(unstructured_path, structured_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{unstructured_path}{File path to the unstructured buildings GeoPackage (.gpkg).}

\item{structured_path}{File path to the structured buildings GeoPackage (.gpkg).}
}
\value{
A patchwork plot object containing maps and a histogram/density plot.
}
\description{
This function reads two spatial datasets (structured and unstructured buildings),
calculates a compactness metric (based on area and perimeter),
filters values to \link{0,1}, summarizes statistics, and produces scientific-grade
comparative visualizations using \code{ggplot2} and \code{patchwork}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
plot_compactness_area_graphs(
  unstructured_path = "path/to/unstructured.gpkg",
  structured_path = "path/to/structured.gpkg"
