\title{Plot Building Area Bins for Structured and Unstructured Buildings}
\usage{
plot_building_area_bins(unstructured_path, structured_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{unstructured_path}{Character. File path to the unstructured buildings GeoPackage.}

\item{structured_path}{Character. File path to the structured buildings GeoPackage.}
}
\value{
A combined ggplot object displaying the two maps side-by-side with a shared legend bar below.
}
\description{
This function reads two spatial datasets of buildings (structured and unstructured),
classifies the building footprints based on their area into predefined bins,
and visualizes them side-by-side as maps with a shared bar chart legend.
}
\details{
The datasets are assumed to be in a projected Coordinate Reference System (CRS),
so that \code{st_area()} produces accurate area measurements in square meters.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
plot_building_area_bins(
  unstructured_path = "path/to/NewCairo_unstructured.gpkg",
  structured_path = "path/to/NewCairo_structured.gpkg"

}
